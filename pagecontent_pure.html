<p>Haxors everywhere, this is your chance to Pwn that Oddy guy for all those times he's trolled you!
<p>Or to help him out if you &lt;3 him, whichever works! 
<p>Or if none of those work, how about the HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS OF BEER JUST FOR YOU IF YOU WIN!?

<li>Be the first to deface this page and win a $100 bartab at Kiwicon to use as you see fit. </li>

<li>Be the first to demonstrably break the RBAC mechanism <!-- pro tip: its flask-security --> "protecting" the edit page, hence being able to deface this page, and win a <h3>$400</h3> bartab at Kiwicon to use as you see fit!</li>

<li>Be the first to mess with other users in some way and win a $100 bartab at Kiwicon that's all yours.</li>

Reporting it consists of emailing me at beau DAWT butler AAAT confide.co.nz , telling me what you did and how you did it. Include your IP etc so i can go back through the sniff0ring and corroborate.

Sorry Scope-haters, but there is some Scope here:<p>

<ol>
<li>* Breaking the RBAC & user-security mechanisms (roles, tokens, logins, users, forgot-password) are what I'm really after here, which is why there is a bigger reward for that</li> 
<li>* DoS attacks aren't Real Haxoring, don't bother</li>
<li>* Messing with the surrounding network is out of scope please, it's Muss's network not mine & we don't want to see Muss's Sad Face now do we?</li>
<li>* If there is a tie, winrar will be determined by email timestamps. Doing stuff and winning after your email was sent will be ignored/grounds for disqualification.</li>
<li>* yes i know the login error messages are a bit too specific, don't care!<.li>
</ol>

HAPPY HAXORING
